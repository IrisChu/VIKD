<h3>Welcome to Pokedex DB! </h3>
<p>Our database provides users with information about trainers and pokemon.
Administrators using the database, such as professors and gym trainers, can log in
to access statistical data about the world and update, add, or delete information
from the database. Regular trainers will be restricted to viewing information
about themselves such as a list of their pokemon, items, and location. They are
not permitted to search up information on other trainers. Visitors can also
view information on pokemon by visting the Pokemon page.</p>
